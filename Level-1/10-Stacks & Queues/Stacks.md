**1. Duplicate Brackets**
```
1. You are given a string exp representing an expression.
2. Assume that the expression is balanced  i.e. the opening and closing brackets match with each other.
3. But, some of the pair of brackets maybe extra/needless. 
4. You are required to print true if you detect extra brackets and false otherwise.
e.g.
((a + b) + (c + d)) -> false
(a + b) + ((c + d)) ->

Input Format: A string str
Output Format: true or false
```

**2. Balanced Brackets**
```
1. You are given a string exp representing an expression.
2. You are required to check if the expression is balanced i.e. closing brackets and opening brackets match up well.

e.g.
[(a + b) + {(c + d) * (e / f)}] -> true
[(a + b) + {(c + d) * (e / f)]} -> false
[(a + b) + {(c + d) * (e / f)} -> false
([(a + b) + {(c + d) * (e / f)}] -> false

Input Format: A string str
Output Format: true or false
```

**3. Next greater element to the right**
```
1. You are given a number n, representing the size of array a.
2. You are given n numbers, representing elements of array a.
3. You are required to "next greater element on the right" for all elements of array
4. Input and output is handled for you.

"Next greater element on the right" of an element x is defined as the first element to right of x having value greater than x.
Note -> If an element does not have any element on it's right side greater than it, consider -1 as it's "next greater element on right"
e.g.
for the array [2 5 9 3 1 12 6 8 7]
Next greater for 2 is 5
Next greater for 5 is 9
Next greater for 9 is 12
Next greater for 3 is 12
Next greater for 1 is 12
Next greater for 12 is -1
Next greater for 6 is 8
Next greater for 8 is -1
Next greater for 7 is -1

Sample Input:
5
5
3
8
-2
7

Sample Output:
8
8
-1
7
-1

**4. Stock Span**
```
1. You are given a number n, representing the size of array a.
2. You are given n numbers, representing the prices of a share on n days.
3. You are required to find the stock span for n days.
4. Stock span is defined as the number of days passed between the current day and the first day before today when price was higher than today.

e.g.
for the array [2 5 9 3 1 12 6 8 7]
span for 2 is 1
span for 5 is 2
span for 9 is 3
span for 3 is 1
span for 1 is 1
span for 12 is 6
span for 6 is 1
span for 8 is 2
span for 7 is 1
```

**5. Largest area histogram**
```
1. You are given a number n, representing the size of array a.
2. You are given n numbers, representing the height of bars in a bar chart.
3. You are required to find and print the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

e.g.
for the array [6 2 5 4 5 1 6] -> 12

Sample Input:
7
6
2
5
4
5
1
6

Sample Output:
12
